# OutlastTrials-ConfigChanges
Config files changes for outlast trials optimization / personal preferences

## Engine.ini
Mostly optimizations for UE4 (documentation found at: https://pongrit.github.io/ )
As well as removing effects like fog, Chromatic Aberration and such. A fair amount of the changes are from an already existing PAYDAY 3 config that can be found on Nexus Mods, the rest was added by me.

Removing those effects make night vision look exactly like no night vision, + the green filter on. No more weird noise and distortion effect, that makes it hard to read from afar.
Also makes indoor maps look better (imo) revealing more on the roof of the maps, and make it look better when looking far ahead of you.

## Game.ini
Changes FOV (Field of View) values. Default is 90, mine is on 110, put whichever you'd like
